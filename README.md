Inspired by this [tweet](https://twitter.com/mcculloughtimes/status/385189088694771712).

Apparently Pedro Martinez on occasion calls home runs "ding dong Johnsons." This Chrome extension replaces any instance of "home run" with "ding dong Johnson," because that is a superior and more descriptive term. 

Installation
------------

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions.  Drag DingDongJohnson.crx into the page that appears.
